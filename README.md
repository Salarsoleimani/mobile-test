## High level overview
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergdort/CleanArchitectureRxSwift/master/Architecture/Modules.png)

#### Domain 

The `Domain` is basically what is the App about and what it can do (Entities, UseCase etc.) **It does not depend on UIKit or any persistence framework**, and it doesn't have implementations apart from entities

#### Platform

The `Platform` is a concrete implementation of the `Domain` in a specific platform like iOS. It does hide all implementation details.

#### Application
`Application` is responsible for delivering information to the user and handling user input. It can be implemented with any delivery pattern e.g (in quiz app is MVVM). This is the place for `UIView`s and `UIViewController`s. As you will see from the quiz app, `ViewControllers` are completely independent of the `Platform`.  The only responsibility of a view controller is to "bind" the UI to the Domain to make things happen.
